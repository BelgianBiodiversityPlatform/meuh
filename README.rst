Meuh!
=====

Meuh is a tool to perform data quality assessments on `Darwin Core Archive`_ (DwC-A) files.

It has the following design goals:

- To be extensible and allow development of new test mechanisms.
- To be UI-independent easiy to integrate in a wide range of data flows: it's currently implemented as a command-line tool but should be easily integrable into web/GUI based tools.
- To provide human-friendly and machine-friendly output.
- To support large data volumes.

Status

In heavy development, nothing usable yet.
